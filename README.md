Developed and taught by Ella Batty, Lucy Lai, Alex Chen, and John Assad

Overview description


Video links below will take you to youtube, tutorial links will open Google colab notebooks.

**The Week 1 videos are a little rough as of now (steep learning curve) so bear with it and they'll get better!**
