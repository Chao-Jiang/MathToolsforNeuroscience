### Description of course


### Description of materials
Video links below will take you to youtube, tutorial links will open Google colab notebooks.

**The Week 1 videos are a little rough as of now (steep learning curve) but bear with it and they get better!** We don't want to reinvent the wheel so when we felt that good videos were already available for topics, we link to those instead. For the majority of the topics though, we have created/will create our own videos. 

We welcome constructive criticism given via opening a git issue.
